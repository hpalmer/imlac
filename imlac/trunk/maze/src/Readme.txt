mazewar.asm is the oldest known version of mazewar, as it existed on Imlacs
at MIT.  It was found posted in an MIT online message board.  The older
versions of mazewar from NASA Ames seem to have been lost.

mazewar-vcf.asm is the version of mazewar that was run on Tom Uban's Imlac
at the Vintage Computer Festival held in Mountain View, CA., in 2004.  The
MIT mazewar.asm assumed the presence of a control program, ssv, which
included the vector character set used by mazewar.  It also assumed a
hardware modification to increase the addressability of display memory
reference instructions.  Also some changes needed to be made to remove
conditional assembly and other directives not yet supported by the new
cross-assembler.
