## Code Developed for the 30-Year MazeWar Anniversary

More information on the event [here](http://www.digibarn.com/collections/games/xerox-maze-war/).

This is code that was very hastily developed for a demonstration of MazeWar running
on an Imlac computer, the platform on which it was originally developed.

The major components include:

* a cross-assembler for the Imlac (Java)
* a loader for the Imlac (Java)
* a MazeWar server program (Java)
* a MazeWar client for Windows (C)

There are also some Imlac assembly language programs, include MazeWar itself, and
some Imlac documentation.

This code has not been maintained for over a decade, so it would not be surprising
if some bit rot has occurred.
